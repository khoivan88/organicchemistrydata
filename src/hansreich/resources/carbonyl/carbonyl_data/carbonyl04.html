<p>What controls the selectivity between deprotonation (basicity) and carbonyl addition (nucleophilicity) of a donor?</p>
<br/>

<p>This is complicated by the reversibility of sulfur, oxygen and some nitrogen nucleophilic attack at carbonyl, and reversibility of deprotonations by all weak bases.</p>
<p>Most of these considerations also apply to S<sub>N</sub>2 (Nu) vs E<sub>2</sub> (base) reactivity</p>
