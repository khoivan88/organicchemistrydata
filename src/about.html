                in organic chemistry, biochemistry, and medicinal chemistry. The pages have been selected for ease of use,
                broad
                applicability, and quality of coverage. Topics will include structural information, organic reactions,
                nomenclature, physical properties, and spectroscopic data. These Web pages will be updated when possible and
                additional Web pages will be added as they become available."

            We encourage others who have collected data useful to organic chemists or who regularly use web sites
            that provide such data to contribute their information to this collection. Please
            <a href="https://www.organicdivision.org/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide us</a> with a
            description of the data and explanation of their use.
