        The vast majority of work on setting up this website and converting the content of Prof. Reich's websites into this form where the content is available in a responsive manner (viewable/useable on phones as well as desktop computers) was accomplished through the immense volunteer efforts of Organic Division Assistant Webmaster Khoi Van (Ph.D., Organic Chemistry with Professor Daniel Romo) with initial oversight, support, and direction from Organic Division Webmaster Brian Myers (Ph.D., Organic Chemistry with Professor David R. Williams) and Organic Division Head Webmaster Joseph Ward (Ph.D., Organic Chemistry with Professor Robert Maleczka).</p>

        We hope that the data and information resources provided on this website and the links to resources off of this website provide Organic Chemists quick access to high quality information to facilitate their efforts in the laboratory and classroom settings. Where possible, references to primary literature are provided for information on this site. Links to resources off of this website are meant to assist individuals in finding high quality information; they are not an endorsement of any product, service, or website.

            We encourage others who have collected data useful to organic chemists or who regularly use web sites
            that provide such data to contribute their information to this collection. Please
            <a href="https://www.organicdivision.org/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide us</a> with a
