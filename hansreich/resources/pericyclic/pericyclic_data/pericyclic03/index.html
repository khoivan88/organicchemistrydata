<div id="fnt"><p><b><span style="font-size:12pt; color:#B6120A;">The Dewar-Zimmerman Moebius-Hückel Approach</span></b></p><p>  Reactions with cyclic transition states which involve continuous orbital overlap can be classified as either aromatic or antiaromatic based on the topology of orbital interactions and the electron count using the Dewar-Zimmerman rules.</p><p>  1. Define a basis set of atomic p orbitals (for heavy atoms) and s orbitals (for hydrogen) for the starting materials of the reaction. You may draw the p-orbitals in any phase - inverting a p orbital simply changes the number of phase inversions by 2 and does not affect the treatment . Then connect the orbital lobes that interact in the starting materials.</p><p>  2. Start the reaction and identify the new interactions that are occurring at the transition state. Count the total number of phase inversion between overlapping orbitals (the phase inversion in traversing a single p-orbital does not count). In the example of the Diels-Alder reaction below there are an even number of phase inversions (2), so this is a Hückel system. If there had been an odd number of phase inversions, this would be a Moebius system.</p><p>  3. Count the number of electrons in the cyclic array of orbitals. Hückel systems are aromatic with 4n+2 π electrons, antiaromatic with 4n electrons. Moebius systems are the reverse - they are aromatic with 4n electrons and antiaromatic with 4n+2 electrons.</p><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/pericyclic/pericyclic_data/img/pericyclic03-00.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  The disrotatory butadiene ring closure/cyclobutene ring opening is a Hückel transition state. Since there are 4 electrons in the array, this is a forbidden mode of reaction.</p><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/pericyclic/pericyclic_data/img/pericyclic03-01.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  The transition state for the conrotatory butadiene closure/cyclobutene opening is a Moebius system, and thus is aromatic with 4 electrons.</p><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/pericyclic/pericyclic_data/img/pericyclic03-02.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  The rules tend to be reversed for photochemical reactions: Hückel transition states are favored for 4n electrons, and Moebius transition states for 4n + 2 electrons.</p><p><i>Novel Pericyclic Reactions in π-Perimeter Chemistry,</i><br>   Hafner, K.; Lindner, H.
