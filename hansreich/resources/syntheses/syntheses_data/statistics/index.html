The Ozonolysis reaction, selenoxide eliminations, olefin metathesis reactions, and reductive aminations would be in the top twenty, depending on how broadly they are defined. Several famous name reactions are not in the top thirty: Reformatsky, Baeyer-Villiger, Hofmann elimination, Dieckman condensation. Others were barely used at all: Cope rearrangement, Darzens condensation, Clemmensen reduction, Favorskii rearrangement, Hunsdiecker reaction, Cope elimination, Beckman rearrangement, Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, Gabriel synthesis, Stetter reaction, Hofmann rearrangement, and Haloform reaction.</p><h4 class="py-3">Index entries:</h4><ol><li>Over 693 total syntheses have been analyzed.</li><li>There are over 15,700 Keyword index entries.</li><li>There are over 12,700 Reagent index entries.</li></ol><p>This collection represents perhaps 2-5% of total syntheses published</p>
