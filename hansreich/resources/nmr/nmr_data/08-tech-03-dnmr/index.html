<div id="fnt"><p align="center"><b><span style="font-size:14pt; color:#B6120A;">8-TECH-3 Measuring Rates by NMR</span></b></p><p>There are three main techniques for measuring rates by NMR spectroscopy:</p><p>  1. <b>Integration of NMR signals as a function of time</b>. This technique is equivalent to other "laboratory time scale" methods for measuring concentration. It is non-invasive, and so is well suited to studying reactive species where intrusive sampling creates contamination problems, and is very convenient. Some chemical processes, such as certain isotopic exchanges, can be measured by almost no other method. Disadvantages are less precise temperature control, a relatively low accuracy in the measurement of concentrations and the derived rate constants (compared, for example with UV spectroscopy or chemical titration), marginal for measurement of Δ<i>H</i><sup>‡</sup> and particularly Δ<i>S</i><sup>‡</sup>, and the requirement that a spectrometer costing hundreds of thousands of dollars be used as a glorified constant temperature bath.</p><p>  <i>Rapid Injection NMR (RINMR)</i>: NMR spectrometers can be fairly easily fitted with a rapid injection device which can be used to mix and take NMR spectra of samples on a second and even sub-second time scale. This allows study of reactions and species having lifetimes in the 0.1 sec to 60 sec range at temperatures down to -130 °C. The technique involves computer-controlled injection of samples directly into an NMR tube in the spectrometer, with computer controlled pulsing at short intervals to detect reactive intermediates.

That is, when there is uncertainty about the lifetime of a spin state (Δt), there is uncertainty about the energy (Δν), which causes line broadening. This is a unique capability of NMR spectrscopy, and many processes whose rates are easily measured by DNMR techniques are virtually impossible to study by any other method.</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-03-dnmr01.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  3. <b>Saturation Transfer (Forsen, EXSY)</b>. When two NMR signals are undergoing dynamic exchange on the timescale of <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, then saturation of one of the signals causes intensity changes in the other, since saturated nuclei will be transferred between the two sites by the exchange process. These intensity changes can be used to obtain quantitative rate data. (<i>Note</i>: although the experiment itself is very similar to an <a href="#08-tech-02-noe">NOE experiment</a>, the underlying physical processes and information obtained is quite different.)</p><p><b><span style="font-size:12pt; color:#B6120A;">8-TECH-3.1 Dynamic NMR (DNMR)</span></b></p><p>  Reversible molecular processes which result in detectable changes in an NMR property (chemical shift or coupling constant) and which occur with rate constants between approximately 10 and 10,000 sec<sup>-1</sup> between -150 and +150 °C (corresponding to Δ<i>G</i><sup>‡</sup> from 5 kcal to 26 kcal/mole) can be studied by variable temperature dynamic NMR (DNMR) techniques. The range of free energies that can be covered depends in a major way on the difference in frequency (chemical shift or coupling constant) of the exchanging signals.</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-03-dnmr02.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  There is an important difference between the DNMR method and classical kinetic measurements: only processes <i>which are at equilibrium</i> can be studied. In the large majority of cases <i>degenerate</i> processes have been studied, i.e., processes for which starting material and product are identical, and <i>K</i><sub>eq</sub> is by definition 1 (as in the cyclohexane inversion below). <i>Non-degenerate</i> processes (such as the chlorocyclohexane inversion) can also be studied, but it is important to recognize that there must be significant amounts of both species/signals present at equilibrium to see DNMR line broadening effects. Thus an NMR time scale interconversion between an observed species and a minor (&lt;&lt;1%) component will usually have <i>no</i> detectable effects on the NMR spectrum, no matter how fast or slow the rate is. For an analysis of the two-site very unequal population problem, see Anet, F. A. L.; et al. <i>J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun.</i> <b>1976</b>, 399.</p><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-03-dnmr03.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  The vast majority of processes studied by DNMR are <span style="color:#E10000;"><b>intra</b></span>molecular in nature. However, a small number of <span style="color:#E10000;"><b>inter</b></span>molecular reactions have also been studied, most notably proton transfers, but acyl transfers, silyl transfers, ate-complex formation/dissociation, Lewis acid Lewis base dissociations, and ligand transfers between metals have also been amenable to study by this technique.</p><p>The DNMR method requires measurement of high quality NMR spectra at a series of accurately known temperatures in the region in which significant line broadening of relevant signals occurs. For intermolecular processes, the effect of a series of concentrations on the rate can also be studied. The determination of accurate rate constants by the DNMR method requires line shape simulations using computer programs such as Binsch's DNMR5 program (Review: Binsch, G. <i>Dynamic NMR Spectrosopy</i>, Jackman, L. M.; Cotton, F. A., Eds., Academic Press, N. Y., 45) or <a class="text-break" href="http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/plt/windnmr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WINDNMR</a>.</p><p>  Crude estimates of rate constants can be obtained from spectral data using several approximate formulas (see Kost, D.; Carlson, E.

There is both an offset error and a slope error (the offset error changes with temperature). This is because the temperature sensing devices in the spectrometer probe are of necessity some distance outside the sample tube and probe coils. The temperature errors are a sensitive function of cooling/heating gas flow rates, so it is necessary to determine the sample temperature for each temperature setting in a variable temperature experiment. There are three main methods for determining sample temperature.</p><p>  1. Direct measurement of temperature with a calibrated thermocouple or RTD thermometer. Before and after each experiment the measuring probe is lowered into the sample (not usually practical) or the sample is removed and an open tube containing solvent and temperature probe is lowered into the NMR probe and the temperature measured.</p><p>  2. Substitution of sample by a chemical shift sample. Here a sample tube containing a material which has a temperature sensitive chemical shift which has been previously calibrated is substituted for the actual sample, and the NMR spectrum is measured. The most commonly used thermometer sample uses the <sup>1</sup>H signals of methanol (the OH signal is temperature dependent), which can be used from -100 to +60 °C. At higher temperatures ethylene glycol is often used (Van Geet, A. L. <i>Anal. Chem.</i> <i>40</i>, <b>1968</b>, 2227; Van Geet, A. L. <i>Anal. Chem.</i> <i>42</i>, <b>1970</b>, 679; Raiford, D. S.; Fisk, C. L.; Becker, E. D. <i>Anal. Chem.</i> <b>1979</b>, <i>51</i>, 2050).</p><p>  3. Both of the above methods require sample substitution and thus do not measure the temperature at the time of the experiment, and they cannot always be used under the actual conditions of the sample experiment. For example the decoupler may have to be turned off during the sample substitution process. Of course, the temperature measuring sample can be placed inside the sample tube (either as a concentric sample tube or as a capillary insert, but this can interfere with sample preparation, and often leads to unacceptable degradation of sample resolution and sensitivity. A better solution is an internal chemical shift thermometer which can be placed directly in the sample of interest, and the temperature is then measured as part of the normal spectrum acquisition process. A compound which is exceptionally good for <sup>13</sup>C variable temperature work is tris(trimethylsilyl)methane (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>3</sub>CH, where the <sup>13</sup>C chemical shift difference between the CH and CH<sub>3</sub> carbons varies linearly with temperature (&gt;1 Hz/°C in a 360 MHz proton frequency spectrometer). Only 1-4 μL of 10% <sup>13</sup>C enriched (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>3</sub><sup>13</sup>CH needs to be added to the sample to provide a true measure of the internal temperature during the actual experiment (Sikorski, W. H.; Sanders, A. W.; Reich, H. J. <i>Magn. Resonan. Chem.</i> <b>1998</b>, <i>36</i>, S118-S124). One disadvantage of this technique is that a calibration curve has to be established for each solvent. A number of these have been reported.</p><p>  In addition to temperature errors resulting from instrumentation issues, the internal temperature of an NMR sample is also perturbed by sample heating from strong decoupling fields (usually <sup>1</sup>H). This effect is especially pronounced in aqueous solutions with significant ionic strength (Led, J. J.; Petersen, S. B. <i>J. Magn. Reson.</i> <b>1978</b>, <i>32</i>, 1-17). Thus sample temperatures will be higher if the decoupler is on than when it is off.</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-03-dnmr06.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p><sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra (90.56 MHz, 360 MHz proton frequency) from a variable temperature study of 0.20 M tris(trimethylsilyl)methane (<sup>13</sup>C-H) in 3:2 THF-ether.</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-03-dnmr07.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  (a) Temperature dependence of the chemical shift difference (Δδ) between the CH<sub>3</sub> and CH of (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>3</sub>CH in various solvents.

The graphic below shows simulated lineshapes of two pairs of signals undergoing identical rates of exchange - the A and B signals exchange with each other and are 33 Hz apart, the C and D signals exchange, and are only 9 Hz apart. Note that before coalescence (up to about 12 sec<sup>-1</sup>) all line widths are the same. However, above this the C/D signals coalesce (at 38 sec<sup>-1</sup>), but the A/B signals continue to broaden, until they coalesce at a much higher rate of exchange (170 sec <sup>-1</sup>), and presumably at substantially higher temperature. Note that above coalescence the line broadening is very strongly dependent on the chemical shift (in fact, it varies as the square of the shift).</p><p>  A consequence of these factors is that the accuracy of activation parameters is strongly affected by the line separation of exchanging signals, since the further apart the signals are, the wider the range of temperatures in which accurate rate measurements can be made, and the more accurate the rate constant will be (broader lines leads to more accurate simulations).

Below some examples of such labeling.</p><p id="08-tech-03-dnmr-phosphole-inv">  <b>Pyramidal inversion in Phosphole</b>. Alkyl and aryl phosphines have high barriers to pyramidal inversion (&gt;35 kcal/mol). For the experiment shown below a phosphole was constructed such that the P-<sup>i</sup>Pr group would be diastereotopic in a static pyramidal structure, but inversion at P would equilibrate the methyl environments. Indeed, at low temperature the isopropyl group shows a pair of dd (each Me is coupled to an H and the P), which shows that the equilibrium structure is non-planar. When the sample is warmed the signals broaden and eventually coalesce to a single dd at high temperature (K. Mislow <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i>, <b>1970</b>, <i>92</i>, 1442). The lowering of the inversion barrier by ca 20 kcal/mole from a non-aromatic model provides an estimate of the aromatic stabilization of the planar phosphole structure which is the presumed transition state for the inversion.</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-03-dnmr25.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p id="08-tech-03-dnmr-carbodiimide-inv">  <b>Inversion-Rotation in Carbodiimide</b>. If inversion/rotation at the C=N bonds is slow, the carbodiimide shown would be chiral, and have diastereotopic isopropyl methyls. In fact, if the sample is cooled to -150 °C, the doublet decoalesces to two doublets (F. A. L. Anet <i>J. Am. Chem.

In the variable temperature <sup>13</sup>C NMR experiment below of a chelated lithiumn reagent several molecular processes can be identified and their rates measured by DNMR. In the static pyramidal structure at low temperature both Si(Me)<sub>2</sub> carbons are diastereotopic (four signals at δ 3 to 7). They begin to broaden above -80 °C as inversion becomes fast on the NMR time scale. Note that initially all four SiMe peaks broaden equally, but the pair that is closer together coalesces at a much lower temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ca -50 °C) than does the other pair (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ca -30 °C). The inversion process does not involve any <i>intermolecular</i> exchange of Li ions, since the Li-C coupling (1:1:1:1 quartet at -7 δ) remains unaffected throughout the temperature range studied.</p><p>  The pyrrolidine ring carbons at δ 58.5 are diastereotopic in the low temperature spectra, but they broaden and coalesce at -70 °C. This process involves decoordination of the pyrrolidine nitrogen from lithium, rotation around the C-N bond, inversion at nitrogen, and re-coordination. It is about a factor of four faster than inversion at carbon (Reich, H. J.; Kulicke, K. J. <i>J. Am. Chem.

The <i>syn</i> bridged annulene is a delocalized aromatic (bis-homo anthracene) compound, as shown by the strong upfield shift of the bridging protons (δ -0.6 and -1.1), and the downfield vinyl protons. In the <i>anti</i>-bridged annulene conjugation is apparently not possible, since the NMR chemical shifts of the bridge protons are normal (δ 1.9 and 2.5). At room temperature the spectrum of the <i>anti</i> compound is symmetric, and shows only a single CH<sub>2</sub> group.

DNMR experiments usually involve changing temperature to change the rates of molecular processes, but other variables which change rates and result in averaging of shifts and coupling constants can also be studied. In the series of spectra below, increments of PMe<sub>3</sub> ligand were added to a solution of a gold-phosphne complex, which initiates a bimolecular exchange between bound and free ligands, causing loss of <sup>3</sup><i>J</i> coupling between the CH<sub>3</sub>-Au protons and P. Initially no change is detectable in the PMe<sub>3</sub> protons because the fraction of free ligand is &lt;1%. When a significant fraction of PMe<sub>3</sub> has been added, however, the PMe<sub>3</sub> signals move downfield because of averaging between free and bound ligand. The apparent coupling also decreases, and becomes 0 at 350% PMe<sub>3</sub>. Coupling between H and P reappears when 9 equivalents of PMe<sub>3</sub> have been added, with <i>J</i> close to that of the pure ligand (2.6 Hz). This shows that <sup>2</sup><i>J</i><sub>HP</sub> has <i>opposite signs</i> in the free and bound ligands (Shiotani, A.; Klein, H. F.; Schmidbauer, H. <i>J. Am. Chem.
