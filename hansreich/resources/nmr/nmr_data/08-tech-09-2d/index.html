The most useful and commonly used forms of 2D NMR spectroscopy provide correlations between proton (or other NMR-active nuclei) signals based on some interaction between them, most frequently J-coupling (H-H. H-C or even C-C), but it could also be dipolar coupling (the NOE interaction), rates of chemical exchange (DNMR swapping of spin environments) or relative diffusion rates (DOSY and related experiments).</p><p>  The most common types of 2D experiments are listed below.</p><p>  <b>COSY</b>: Homonuclear correlated spectroscopy. Correlation between protons that are coupled to each other. (Bax <i>J. Magn. Reson. </i><b>1981</b>, <i>42</i>, 169). There are many modified version of the basic COSY experiment: DQF-COSY (double-quantum filtered), COSY45, LRCOSY, ECOSY.</p><p>  <b>TOCSY</b>: Total Correlation Spectroscopy (also referred to as the HOHAHA experiment). Uses a spin-lock for coherence transfer. During the spin-lock all protons of a coupled system become "strongly coupled," leading to cross peaks between all resonances of a coupled system. Has some advantages over COSY in that small couplings can be detected (in COSY small couplings give very weak cross-peaks because the peaks are antiphase).</p><p>  <b>CH-COSY</b> or <b>HETCOR</b>: Heteronuclear correlation, usually between <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C resonances mediated by <i>J</i><sub>C-H</sub>. The experiment can be run using either <sup>1</sup><i>J</i><sub>C-H</sub> or longer range couplings. It has poor sensitivity because the observed nucleus is <sup>13</sup>C, and has been largely replaced by the inverse detection experiments HMBC and HMQC. (Review: Martin, Zektzer <i>Magn. Reson. Chem.</i> <b>1988</b>, <i>26</i>, 631). For examples see: Lankin <i>J. Org. Chem. </i><b>1990</b>, <i>55</i>, 5139.</p><p>  <b>HMQC</b>: Proton detected heteronuclear multiquantum coherence. Similar to CH-COSY or HETCOR experiment, except that the inverse detection using a DEPT sequence provides much better sensitivity (Bax <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i> <b>1986</b>, <i>108</i>, 4285). Used to correlate proton and carbon signals using either one bond or longer range couplings. For examples see Bashkin <i>J. Org. Chem.</i> <b>1990</b>, <i>55</i>, 5125.</p><p>  <b>HSQC</b>: Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence. This is a CH correlation experiment which uses proton detection of the <sup>13</sup>C signals using an INEPT sequence. It shows higher resolution in the C-dimension than does the related HMQC experiment.</p><p>  <b>HMBC</b>: Heteronuclear Multi-Bond Connectivity. This experiment is a lot like HMQC, but it is optimized to detect proton-carbon correlation over 2 and/or 3 bonds (Bax, <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i><b>1986</b>, <i>108</i>, 2093). Although the sensitivity is better than direct detection methods, it is still not very good, since the magnetization has to be transferred twice, first from proton to carbon and then back to proton via weak long-range interactions, which require relatively long delay times and thus much opportunity for loss of signal intensity by <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> relaxation. For a modification to distinguish 2 from 3-bond coupling see: Griesinger, <i>Tetrahedron Lett. </i><b>1996</b>, <i>37</i>, 363.</p><p>  <b>EXSY</b>: Exchange Spectroscopy - the 2D equivalent of the Forsen saturation transfer experiment. The transfer of magnetization, however, is due to chemical exchange between A and B, rather than an NOE. EXSY uses an identical pulse sequence to the NOESY experiment, and is thus subject to interference by NOE. The magnetization transfer will be the equivalent of a negative NOE (Perrin, C. L.; Dwyer, T. <i>Chem. Rev</i>. <b>1990</b>, <i>90</i>, 935).</p><p>  <b>NOESY, ROESY</b>: Proton-proton correlation mediated by dipolar coupling (NOE effect). Correlation between protons that are close in space. This is the single most powerful NMR technique for determining the 3-dimensional structure of molecules - from conformations and configurations of small molecules to the 3-dimensional structure of small proteins.</p><p>  <b>HOESY:</b> Heteronuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy. Correlation between protons and heteronuclei that are close in space. Requires that the heteronucleus be relaxed significantly by dipole-dipole interactions with nearby protons or other magnetic nuclei, and so fails with nuclei relaxed exclusively by chemical shift anisotropy or quadrupolar mechanisms. Used extensively in the spectroscopy of organolithium reagents, since <sup>6</sup>Li works well in this experiment.</p><p>  <b>INADEQUATE</b>: Incredible Natural Abundance Double Quantum Transfer Experiment. 2-Dimensional <i>J</i><sub>C-C</sub> This double quantum coherence experiment produces a C-C correlation using <sup>1</sup><i>J</i><sub>CC</sub>. It is perhaps the most powerful structure-determination tool of all, but suffers from very low sensitivity (Bax, A.; Freeman, R.; Frenkiel, T. A.; Levitt, M. H. <i>J. Magn. Res.</i> <b>1981</b>, <i>43</i>, 478)</p><p>  <b>DOSY, PGSE</b>: Diffusion-Ordered SpectroscopY, Pulsed Gradient Spin-Echo. In these experiments molecular diffusion is detected by applying a pulse gradient of varying strength for a set time period, and measuring the loss of signal intensity resulting from diffusion as a function of gradient strength. The method provides a way of estimating molecular weights (to the extent they relate to diffusion coefficients) of multiple NMR active species in a single solution, and is well suited to help characterize reactive species which cannot be purified or isolated.</p><p><b><span style="font-size:12pt; color:#B6120A;">Relationship Between Free Induction Decay and Spectrum</span></b></p><p>  Before we can discuss multi-pulse NMR experiments (including 2D experiments) we have to review the basics of FT NMR. The simplest NMR experiment is a 90° (π/2) pulse, followed by measurement of the Free Induction Decay (FID, magnetization in the y' direction of the rotating frame). The magnetization will rotate around the Z axis at a rate of 1/Δν, where Δν is the difference in frequency between the spectrometer pulse, and the Larmor precession of the nucleus.</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d00.gif" class="img-fluid"> <br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d01.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  Among the most important multi-pulse experiments are those in which correlations or distinctions between chemical shifts and couplings are made. On the following page are depicted the evolution of magnetization of a series of multiplets as a function of time, and the expected appearance of the spectrum if an FID was collected at the end of the time period, and FT'd.</p><p>  Note the different behavior of the multiplets, particularly at a delay time of 1/J.</p><p><b><span style="font-size:12pt; color:#B6120A;">Time Evolution of Magnetization Vectors Signals</span></b></p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d02.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p><b><span style="font-size:12pt; color:#B6120A;">The Spin-Echo Pulse Sequence for Distinguishing Couplings and Chemical Shifts</span></b></p><p>  The spin-echo sequence, in which a 180° pulse is placed exactly in the middle of a delay period t<sub>1</sub>, is central to most multi-pulse NMR experiments. In addition to refocusing magnetic field inhomogeneities, it refocuses chemical shifts, so that at the end of the delay period all magnetization which was initially in the y' direction will again be in the y' direction, UNLESS the signal was part of a homonuclear spin system. In the latter case, the signals will not refocus, but continue to evolve throughout the delay period. This is because the 180° pulse will also invert the coupling partner (α to β, β to α) so that the population which was "slow" before the refocussing pulse becomes "fast" after, and vice versa. There is thus a fundamental difference between the behavior of a chemical shift and a coupled multiplet.</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d03.gif" class="img-fluid"> <br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d04.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  As illustrated above, if the total delay period t<sub>1</sub> is 1/Δν for the chemically shifted pair of peaks, or 1/<i>J</i> for the doublet, then the chemical shifted peaks will be positive when the FID is collected, and the doublet negative. This behavior is fundamental for all 1D and 2D experiments which involve the manipulation and detection of couplings.</p><p>  If the doublet is due to a heteronuclear coupling (AX), then the A doublet will behave identically to the chemically shifted peaks, since the required inversion of the spin of the coupling partner X will not have happened. Such experiments can still be done, however. All that is required is a simultaneous 180° pulse on the X nucleus, as illustrated for the APT experiment described below.</p><h5 class="pt-5 text-danger font-weight-bold" id="08-tech-09-APT">The Attached Proton Test - Distinguishing Couplings and Chemical Shifts</h5><p>  The Attached Proton Test (APT) experiment takes advantage of the different effects of a pulse delay and a refocusing pulse on peaks separated by a chemical shift and those separated by a coupling constant. Here we are taking a <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum using a spin-echo sequence that gives either positive or negative peaks depending on whether there are an even or odd number of hydrogens on the carbon.</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d05.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  In contrast to the homonuclear spin-echo sequence, where both the observed proton and its coupling partner are inverted, in the heteronuclear version only the observed nucleus (in this case <sup>13</sup>C) is inverted by the 180° pulse, so a simultaneous 180° pulse has to be applied to the protons to make sure that only chemical shifts are refocused and C-H couplings continue to evolve. In addition, the decoupler is turned on during collection of the FID, so C-H couplings are not observed in the spectrum.</p><p>  The most useful delay is t<sub>1</sub> = 1/<i>J</i>, when C and CH<sub>2</sub> peaks are positive, CH and CH<sub>3</sub> peaks are negative. See the Figure below for a graphic depiction of the behavior of signal intensity as a function of the delay period t<sub>1</sub>.</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d06.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  Reference to the Figure on time evolution of multiplet signals shows that at a pulse delay of 0.5/<i>J</i> only the singlet (quaternary carbon) has net magnetization in the x direction, all others have either offsetting x and -x vectors (CH<sub>2</sub>), or magnetization only in the y/-y direction (CH, CH<sub>3</sub>). Thus this experiment will give a quaternary carbon-only spectrum. More precisely, this experiment will suppress all signals with J = 2t<sub>1</sub>, where t<sub>1</sub> is the total delay. If there are C-H couplings significantly different than 2t<sub>1</sub> (as would be the case for a C≡C-H proton), then C signals may be only partially, or not at all suppressed.</p><p>  This experiment has been largely replaced by the DEPT pulse sequence, which gives similar information, but with much better signal to noise, since the sequence includes polarization transfer from proton to carbon. The DEPT sequence cannot be understood in terms of vector diagrams of the sort used here.</p><p>  A simple APT experiment. The bottom spectrum is a normal acquisition of a <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum. In the middle spectrum a delay time t<sub>1</sub> of 1/J has been applied, leading to positive C and CH2 signals, and negative CH and CH<sub>3</sub> signals. In the top spectrum a delay of 0.5/J, to give a spectrum showing only quaternary carbons.</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d07.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p><b><span style="font-size:12pt; color:#B6120A;">8-TECH-9.2 The 2DJ Experiment - Chemical Shifts and Couplings on Perpendicular Axes</span></b></p><p>  The 2DJ experiment is not used very often, but it is one of the simplest 2D NMR experiments to understand. For the homonuclear case, the pulse sequence is:</p><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d08.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  After this sequence, all signals which have only a chemical shift (singlets, the central peaks of triplets and quintets, etc) will be refocused in the y' direction, and measurement of the FID followed by Fourier transformation (FT) will result in a properly phased positive peak. Any peak which is offset due to a coupling will not be refocused, and will have different phase depending on the delay time t<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>  Below are several spin-echo NMR spectra of alanylglycine, showing the phase modulation as a function of delay time.</p><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d09.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  A series of spectra are taken where the variable delay <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> is uniformly incremented, as shown below. Any peak which is offset by a coupling will be phase modulated at the frequency offset from the center peak (follow the tips of the two outer lines of the triplet).</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d10.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  These spectra are then Fourier Transformed in the F<sub>1</sub> dimension by taking one point from each spectrum. Signals which have no coupling component, such as the central peak of the triplet, will not be phase modulated, and will appear at the origin (0 Hz offset). Signals which have a coupling component will be phase modulated, and will be offset by the appropriate frequency (0.5 <i>J</i> for doublets, 1.0 <i>J</i> for the outer peaks of triplets). The FT process can distinguish positive and negative frequencies since the dispersion-mode component of the signals is phased in opposite directions.</p><br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/nmr/nmr_data/img/08-tech-09-2d11.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  The two-dimensional spectrum that results has the coupling "tilted" by 45° from the original axis.

Thus the carbon signals need to be in phase at the time the decoupler is turned on, else the signal will be reduced or lost altogether. This means that a pulse sequence considerably more complicated than the simplest H-H COSY pulse sequences is required.
