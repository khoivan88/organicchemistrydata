For the Me<sub>2</sub>S(O)CH<sub>2</sub> ylid, the initial carbonyl addition is reversible, with the more stable equatorial betaine intermediate leading to the only observed product.</p><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/carbonyl/carbonyl_data/img/carbonyl23-01.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  It is also possible that the intermediate from axial attack cyclizes more slowly, since the leaving group has to occupy the congested region above the cyclohexane ring</p><p>  A similar situation obtains for the competition between epoxide formation versus cyclopropanation of enones. The Me<sub>2</sub>SCH<sub>2</sub> ylid irreversibly adds 1,2, leading to epoxide. The 1,2-addition of Me<sub>2</sub>S(O)CH<sub>2</sub> is highly reversible, and the more stable 1,4 adduct leads to the major product.</p><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/carbonyl/carbonyl_data/img/carbonyl23-02.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p><b><span style="font-size:10pt; color:#B6120A;">Felkin Model for Stereochemistry of Nucleophilic Addition to Cyclohexanone</span></b></p><p>  It is experimentally observed that small nucleophiles tend to add to cyclohexanones in an axial fashion, whereas sterically large nucleophiles tend to add equatorially.</p><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/carbonyl/carbonyl_data/img/carbonyl23-03.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  Felkin provided support for this analysis by noting that in the addition of the 3-t-butylallylmagnesium bromide below, there was a significant amount of product from reaction at the more hindered end of the allyl system in the product of equatorial attack, but none detected in the axial attack product (Cherest, M.; Felkin, H. <i>Tetrahedron Lett.</i> <b>1971</b>, 383-386.).</p><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/carbonyl/carbonyl_data/img/carbonyl23-04.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>  Similar considerations explain the higher reactivity of cyclohexanones over cyclopentanones in carbonyl additions. In cyclopentanone the C=O interactions with neighboring C-H are largely staggered, but become more eclipsed during the rerduction. In cyclohexanone the C=O and equatorial C-H are almost eclipsed, and become staggered at the transition state for hydride addition.</p><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/carbonyl/carbonyl_data/img/carbonyl23-05.gif" class="img-fluid"> <p>NaBH<sub>4</sub> reduction: k(cyclohexanone) / k(cyclopentanone) = 23 (Brown, H. C.; Ichikawa, K. <i>Tetrahedron</i> <b>195</b>7, <i>1</i>, 221.)</p><p>  Conversely, formation of carbonyl groups is favored in cyclopentanones, with cyclopentanone ethylene ketal hydrolyzing 13 times as fast with acid than cyclohexanone ketal (Conan, J-Y.; Natat, A.; Priolet, D. <i>Bull.
