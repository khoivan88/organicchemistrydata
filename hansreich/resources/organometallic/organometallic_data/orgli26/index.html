Simple alkyl-, vinyl- or alkynyllithium reagents usually react poorly, so that one of several modes of activation must be used: conversion to a cuprate, activation of nucleophile with a polar cosolvent like HMPA, or activation of electrophile with a Lewis acid.</p>  <br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/organometallic/organometallic_data/img/orgli197.gif" class="img-fluid"></div>
