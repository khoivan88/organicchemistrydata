A very persistent problem with these reactions is the propensity for polymerization, since the nucleophilic addition generates a new donor species (enolate, nitronate anion, <span style="font-family:Symbol">a</span>-lithio sulfone, etc) which can compete with the nucleophile for the remaining activated olefin (of course anionic polymerization of monomers like styrene, butadiene, isoprene and methyl methacrylate are hugely important industrial processes).</p>  <br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/organometallic/organometallic_data/img/orgli135.gif" class="img-fluid">   <br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/organometallic/organometallic_data/img/orgli136.gif" class="img-fluid"><p><b><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:12pt; color:#8b0000">Successful conjugate additions</span></b></p><p>There are two main categories of conjugate addition that are successful in avoiding polymerization:</p><p>  (1) The nucleophile is relatively nonbasic (usually less basic than the product enolate), and the conjugate addition is performed under protic conditions so that the product enolate is rapidly protonated. For such reactions the initial addition may be endothermic, but the protonation is exothermic enough to drive the reaction. The classic Michael addition is of this type, as are the conjugate additions of thiolates, selenolates amines and nitronate anions. For these reactions the 1,2-addition (if plausible) is highly reversible, whereas the 1,4-addition is much less so.</p>  <br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/organometallic/organometallic_data/img/orgli137.gif" class="img-fluid"><p>  (2) The product enolate is less reactive than the donor, and thus does not compete for the acceptor. Such reactions are run under aprotic conditions, usually with kinetic control. It is this type of conjugated addition that we are interested in here.</p>  <br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/organometallic/organometallic_data/img/orgli138.gif" class="img-fluid"><p>A more complex example from the synthesis of <b>Shahamin K</b>: Lebsack, A.

Organolithium reagents generally add to the carbonyl group of <span style="font-family:Symbol">a</span>,<span style="font-family:Symbol">b</span>-unsaturated ketones and aldehydes (1,2-addition). Conjugate addition (1,4-addition) can be achieved in several ways:</p><p><b>Equilibration</b>. The 1,4-adduct is almost always thermodynamically more stable than the 1,2-adduct (both at the initial anionic adduct stage as well as at the final protonated product stage). Thus, when the 1,2-addition is reversible (i.e., when the pKa of the nucleophile conjugate acid is well below 30) then isomerization of 1,2- to the 1,4-adduct is possible.</p>  <br><img src="/organicchemistrydata/hansreich/resources/organometallic/organometallic_data/img/orgli140.gif" class="img-fluid"><p>All relatively weak nucleophiles behave this way: CN<sup>-</sup>, PhS<sup>-</sup>, most enolates, metalated nitriles, as well as some well stabilized organolithium reagents, such as the 2-phenyldithianyllithium above.</p><p><b>Effect of HMPA and DMPU</b>. Many stabilized (heteroatom-substituted) organolithium reagents will switch from principally 1,2- to mainly 1,4-addition when solvent polarity is increased. Brown, C. A.; Yamaichi, A. <i>J. Chem.
