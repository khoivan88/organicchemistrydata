<p>DMSO in combination with an activating agent (usually an acylating agent or an acid) and an amine base is a very mild and selective reagent for oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones.  The oxidation was discovered by Moffat, but a very popular modification using oxalyl chloride/triethylamine was introduced by Swern, so the reaction is often referred to as a Swern oxidation. Over-oxidation is not a problem, and the reagent does not cleave glycols and <span style="font-family:Symbol">a</span>-hydroxy carbonyl compounds like the transition metal oxidants (Cr, Ru, Os, Mn) do.</p>
