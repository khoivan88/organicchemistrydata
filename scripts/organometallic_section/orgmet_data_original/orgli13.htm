<p>Many kinds of alkenes substituted with electron withdrawing groups undergo facile addition reactions with nucleophiles, including lithium reagents.  A very persistent problem with these reactions is the propensity for polymerization, since the nucleophilic addition generates a new donor species (enolate, nitronate anion, <span style='font-family:Symbol'>a</span>-lithio sulfone, etc) which can compete with the nucleophile for the remaining activated olefin (of course anionic polymerization of monomers like styrene, butadiene, isoprene and methyl methacrylate are hugely important industrial processes).</p>

<p><b><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:12pt; color:#8b0000">Successful conjugate additions</span></b></p>
<p>There are two main categories of conjugate addition that are successful in avoiding polymerization:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  The nucleophile is relatively nonbasic (usually less basic than the product enolate), and the conjugate addition is performed under protic conditions so that the product enolate is rapidly protonated.  For such reactions the initial addition may be endothermic, but the protonation is exothermic enough to drive the reaction.  The classic Michael addition is of this type, as are the conjugate additions of thiolates, selenolates amines and nitronate anions. For these reactions the 1,2-addition (if plausible) is highly reversible, whereas the 1,4-addition is much less so.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img src="_chem842-02-orgli{137}.gif">

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)  The product enolate is less reactive than the donor, and thus does not compete for the acceptor.  Such reactions are run under aprotic conditions, usually with kinetic control.  It is this type of conjugated addition that we are interested in here.</p>

<p>A more complex example from the synthesis of <b>Shahamin K</b>: Lebsack, A. D.; Overman, L. E.; Valentkovitch, R. J. <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i> <b>2001</b>, <i>123</i>, 4851.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<p>In addition to the problem of polymerization, for carbonyl acceptors there is also the question of regioselectivity of the addition.  Organolithium reagents generally add to the carbonyl group of <span style='font-family:Symbol'>a</span>,<span style='font-family:Symbol'>b</span>-unsaturated ketones and aldehydes (1,2-addition).  Conjugate addition (1,4-addition) can be achieved in several ways:</p>
<p><b>Equilibration</b>.  The 1,4-adduct is almost always thermodynamically more stable than the 1,2-adduct (both at the initial anionic adduct stage as well as at the final protonated product stage).  Thus, when the 1,2-addition is reversible (i.e., when the pKa of the nucleophile conjugate acid is well below 30) then isomerization of 1,2- to the 1,4-adduct is possible. </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img src="_chem842-02-orgli{140}.gif">

<p>All relatively weak nucleophiles behave this way: CN<sup>-</sup>, PhS<sup>-</sup>, most enolates, metalated nitriles, as well as some well stabilized organolithium reagents, such as the 2-phenyldithianyllithium above.</p>

<p><b>Effect of HMPA and DMPU</b>.  Many stabilized (heteroatom-substituted) organolithium reagents will switch from principally 1,2- to mainly 1,4-addition when solvent polarity is increased. Brown, C. A.; Yamaichi, A. <i>J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun.</i> <b>1979</b>, 100; Reich, Sikorski <i>J. Org. Chem.</i> <b>1999</b>, <i>6</i>, 14.  This method does not work well with alkyl, aryl and vinyllithium reagents.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Hindered Lewis acids</b>. Extremely hindered aluminum phenoxides complex to the carbonyl group, and apparently sterically protect the C=O carbon from the electrophile.  Amazingly, conjugate addition can be achieved even with aromatic aldehydes and ketones.  Maruoka, Imoto, Saito, Yamamoto <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i> <b>1994</b>, <i>116</i>, 4131; Yamamoto <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i> <b>1995</b>, <i>117</i>, 9091.</p>

<p><b>Transition Metal Organometallic Reagents.</b>  Alkyl, vinyl and aryl organocuprates show a strong propensity to add conjugatively to enones.  Cuprates formed from more stabilized carbanions usually are not very reactive (lithioalkynes, enolates, lithio sulfones, etc).</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<p><b>Vinyl Sulfones</b> are generally good Michael acceptors towards organolithium reagents.  The sulfonyl group itself is very resistant to attack, so &#34;1,2-addition&#34; is not a problem (this is in contrast to sulfoxides, which are attacked by alkyllithium reagents to give the products of Li/S=O exchange).  P. L. Fuchs <i>J. Org. Chem.</i> <b>1987</b>, <i>52</i>, 473.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:12pt; color:#8b0000">Addition of Organolithium Reagents to <u>Unactivated</u> C-C Multiple Bonds</span></b></p>
<p>Alkyllithium reagents will add to ethylene itself, and to weakly activated vinyl groups such those of styrene, butadiene and trimethylsilyethene.  The intramolecular addition has a broader range: triple bonds and mono-alkyl substituted double bonds react with alkyl-, vinyl-, and aryllithiums if a five-membered ring is being formed.  </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<p>Intramolecular addition is especially facile in the cyclopropylcarbinyl -- homoallyl anion system.  This interconversion is reversible, with the equilibrium generally on the side of the homoallyl structure (exceptions are when the cyclopropylcarbinyl anionic carbon is substituted with carbanion stabilizing groups).  Such rearrangements are also known for Grignard reagents and other organometallics, as well as for the cyclopropylcarbinyl radical and carbonium ion.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-family:arial; font-size:12pt; color:#8b0000">Addition of Organolithium Reagents to <u>Unactivated</u> C-C Multiple Bonds</span></b></p>
<p>Lithium reagents are generally not the most effective organometallic reagents for addition to unactivated or weakly activated olefins.  Grignard reagents or Zinc reagents are often more effective.  Presumably coordination of the double bond to the metal is an important part of the carbometalation process.</p>
