## Purpose

Round 2 on fixing pages in Hans Reich's Total Syntheses section.

Updates include:

- For each synthesis page:
  - Add html class 'synthesis' for each synthesis image for easier identification
  - Remove '<div id="dot"></div>' inside each synthesis
  - Remove '<!--that which shall hold the dot-->'
- For index pages, if exists, html5 data tag is added to display animated arrow pointing to the step of interest.
