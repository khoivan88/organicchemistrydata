<p>
This website is made possible by a generous allocation of server space and bandwidth from, previously, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, and, now, the ACS Division of Organic Chemistry. The National Science Foundation is acknowledged for financial support to Professor Hans Reich who created the database of syntheses. Prof. Kevin Jantzi (Valparaiso University) provided many of the DOI references, and he is thanked for his efforts on this onerous task. Professor Reich also acknowledged several contributors to this collection including: Mateusz Plesniak (20), Kris Kolonko (6), Amanda Jones (1), Kristen Plessel (1), Almaz Jalilov (1), and Kevin Schultz (1). Finally, Dr. Khoi Van (Assistant Webmaster of the ACS Division of Organic Chemistry) is acknowledged for his extensive volunteer efforts in converting Professor Reich's database out of frames into its current website (responsive form) in June 2020.
