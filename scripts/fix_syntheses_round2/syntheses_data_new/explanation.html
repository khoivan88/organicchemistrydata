<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p class="">
This collection of short natural product syntheses (a few “unnatural” products are also included. e.g.
cubane, twistane, triquinacene) was initially assembled over many years as a source of classroom
examples, problems, and examination questions in a senior undergraduate/beginning graduate level
course in organic chemistry. It has since matured into a comprehensive summary of the many
techniques and reagents used in total synthesis. It serves as a interesting and unique guide to which of
these are actually being used in natural product synthesis. For example, LiN'Pr. is the most commonly
used reagent in organic synthesis (ignoring NEt3, which is often present only to neutralize acid, and not
an active participant in the molecular transformation).
</p>
<p class="">
The syntheses were selected for the inclusion of one or more key reactions that illustrate important
transformation of general utility (syntheses which used a minimum of "magic reactions” were preferred),
for their brevity, and for a presentation style in the original journal that permitted ready preparation of the
synthetic schemes.
</p>
<p class="">
Currently the name of the synthetic target is indexed, and there are compound Names, Reactions,
Reagents, Named Reactions, Rings, Chemoselectivity (competition) and chronological indices (Year).
These indices will continue to be improved and expanded in future releases.
