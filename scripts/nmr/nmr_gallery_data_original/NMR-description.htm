This section contains NMR spectra and some IR spectra useful for teaching undergraduate and graduate organic spectroscopy. They have been selected because significant part structures can be obtained by analysis of coupling patterns. The multiplets to be analyzed are all strictly first order (except for aromatic multiplets), and the molecules are not too large and contain only common functional groups. Some guidelines for use of the collection:
<ul>
<li>Please leave the spectrum header on the spectra so that the solvent and spectrometer frequency are properly identified, the efforts of individuals who contributed to the collection are recognized.
<li>For some of the compounds <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra are included.

<li>Minor editing of these PDF files (e.g., deleting, editing or moving integral numbers, other text editing, cropping of unneeded parts of the page, removing extraneous expansions, moving expansions around, etc) can be done with Adobe Acrobat Writer (you cannot do this with the free Adobe Acrobat Reader) or with some other PDF-editing program (Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop)
</ul>

<p><b>Level 1: </b> These NMR spectra are probably too simple and the molecules too small to be used as problems or exam questions, but well suited for illustrating simple coupling patterns and chemical shifts.

<p><b>Level 2: </b> These spectra have only one coupled set of protons, in addition to a singlet and/or a phenyl multiplet. Each multiplet shows simple coupling such as d, t, q, pentet, etc (as opposed to the dd, dt, tt etc type involving two or more different couplings to the same proton).<p>

<p><b>Level 3:</b> These follow the guidelines as for the "Level 2" spectra, except that there may be overlapping multiplets which need to be properly parsed, and/or there may be more than one set of coupled protons which need to be analyzed.

<p><b>Level 4:</b> These are first-order spectra (apart from phenyl groups) in which there are complicating features like two different couplings to the same proton, long range couplings, minor second order effects (leaning) or signal overlaps which may permit more than one interpretation. They are not necessarily more difficult to solve than Level 3 problems, but do require more knowledge of NMR spectroscopy to analyze properly. The section on <a href="nmr-content.htm#names-arom" target="contents">aromatic compounds</a> also contains many spectra at this level of difficulty.

<p>The collection also contains many NMR spectra that have a variety of more complicated features: <a href="nmr-content.htm#names-spin" target="contents">extended coupling networks</a>, diastereotopic protons, second order effects, various specialized <a href="nmr-content.htm#names-techniques"  target="contents">techniques</a> (multinuclear, NOE, DNMR, etc). Many were used as examples and exercises in the notes for the graduate NMR course at Wisconsin (<a href="../nmr/index.htm" target="_top">NMR course notes (Chem 605)</a>. They provide high resolution spectra in the web notes.
