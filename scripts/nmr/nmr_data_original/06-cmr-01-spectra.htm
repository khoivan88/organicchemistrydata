<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The low natural abundance of the NMR active isotope of carbon, <sup>13</sup>C, makes the measurement and interpretation of carbon NMR spectra a considerably different process than measurement and analysis of proton NMR spectra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>  I = &frac12;     Natural abundance: 1.1&#37;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>C<sub>6</sub>  I = 0      Natural abundance: 98.9&#37;</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:12pt; color:#990000;">6-CMR-1.1 Sensitivity</span></b></p>
<p>The low natural abundance of <sup>13</sup>C has three principal consequences:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  It can be much more time-consuming to obtain <sup>13</sup>C than <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra, especially if quantities or solubility is limited.  Whereas an <sup>1</sup>H spectrum on 1 mg of a typical organic compound can usually be obtained in 15-30 minutes of spectrometer time, it might take several hours to obtain a much lower quality <sup>13</sup>C spectrum on the same sample. This is because, in addition to the 1&#37; natural abundance of <sup>13</sup>C (vs &gt;99&#37; for <sup>1</sup>H), the Boltzman population difference between the &alpha; and &beta; states is smaller (the energy difference is only 1/4 as large), and the weaker magnetic dipole makes signals inherently harder to detect.  Thus, unless your compound does not have useful <sup>1</sup>H signals, you will usually measure many more <sup>1</sup>H than <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inherent sensitivity: 1.59&#37; (<sup>1</sup>H = 100). Sens. = (&gamma;<sub>C</sub>/&gamma;<sub>H</sub>)<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual sensitivity: 0.017&#37; (1/5700)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  The effects of <sup>13</sup>C nuclei on spectra of other nuclei (e.g., <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>31</sup>P) are very minor.  Each proton (or F, P) signal is surrounded by <i><a href="06-cmr-05-1jch.htm"><sup>13</sup>C satellites</a></i> separated by <sup>1</sup><i>J</i><sub>C-H</sub> (typically 120-150 Hz), each with an intensity of 0.5&#37; of the central peak.  There are also close in satellites from longer range couplings to carbon - <sup>2</sup><i>J</i><sub>C-H</sub> and <sup>3</sup><i>J</i><sub>C-H</sub>, typically 2-15 Hz.   The central peak arises from the 98.9&#37; of <sup>12</sup>C which is NMR transparent. The inner <sup>13</sup>C satellites are often hard to resolve from the central peak(s), but the outer ones can be readily detected for sharp peaks.  In addition to being useful for measuring proton-carbon couplings, these satellites can sometimes be used for <a href="05-hmr-03-jcoupl.htm#05-hmr-03-jcoupl-c13satellite">measurement of <i>J</i><sub>HH</sub></a> between equivalent protons. They are also useful as integration standards for quantifying the amount of minor isomers or other impurities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Coupling between carbons (<i>J</i><sub>CC</sub>) is not usually observed, because two adjacent <sup>13</sup>C nuclei occur in only 1.1&#37; of the carbons.  There are thus <sup>13</sup>C satellites on the carbon peaks (each about 0.5&#37; of the intensity of the main peak), in the same way that there are <sup>13</sup>C satellites on proton spectra.  The couplings can be measured directly with some difficulty by accumulating many scans on a very concentrated sample, but a better way is to use one of the multi-pulse 2D experiments (e.g., INADEQUATE) which nulls the central peaks due to adjacent <sup>12</sup>C atoms. Even so, large samples and long acquisition times are required.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:12pt; color:#990000;">6-CMR-1.2 <a name="06-cmr-01-spectra-decoupling">Decoupling</a>   </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra are very complex.  The methyl carbon of an ethoxy group will appear as a large quartet, with each line further split into triplets.  Even in fairly simple molecules each carbon may be coupled to a number of different protons.  In complicated molecules, these multiplets overlap badly, and may be impossible to analyze.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup><i>J</i><sub>CH</sub> = 100-250 Hz<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2,3</sup><i>J</i><sub>CH</sub>  = 2-10 Hz<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To simplify <sup>13</sup>C spectra, we usually use some form of broadband decoupling (noise decoupling) to remove the effect of proton couplings.  This also dramatically increases signal intensity, since now all carbons appear as singlets (assuming absence of other spin 1/2 nuclei like <sup>31</sup>P or <sup>19</sup>F).  The increase is actually greater by a factor of 2-3 than would be predicted on the basis of simply combining the <sup>13</sup>C multiplet intensities because the <a href="08-tech-02-noe.htm">Nuclear Overhauser Effect</a> causes additional increases in signal intensity.  More about this in Section 8.2.</p>

<p>Figure 6-1.2. 25 MHz <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of diphenyl selenide in CDCl<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 6-1.2 shows the fully coupled and decoupled <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of diphenyl selenide.  Although the large <sup>1</sup><i>J</i><sub>C-H</sub> splittings are easy to identify, the fine structure of the individual multiplets is not first order (e.g., only the para carbon has an approximately centrosymmetric pattern, the others do not).  This is because we are looking at the <b>X</b> part of an <b>AA'BB'CX</b> pattern (<a href="05-hmr-07-pople.htm"><b>ABC</b></a> are protons, <b>X</b> is carbon).  Since the <b>AA'</b> and <b>BB'</b> parts are strongly coupled, we see the usual complex effects of &#34;virtual coupling&#34; on the <b>X</b> resonance (see <a href="05-hmr-14-a2b2.htm">Section 5-15</a>, <a href="05-hmr-16-virt-coupl.htm">Section 5-16</a>).  When noise {<sup>1</sup>H} decoupling is applied, the spectrum becomes much more intense, and only 4 lines remain, one for each carbon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this compound we have a second magnetically active nucleus (<sup>77</sup>Se, natural abundance 7.5&#37;, I = 1/2), so each of the <sup>13</sup>C peaks has <sup>77</sup>Se satellites, although coupling between C-4 and the selenium is too small to detect (the satellites are under the main peak).</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:12pt; color:#990000;">6-CMR-1.3 <a name="06-cmr-01-spectra-apt">Attached Proton Tests</a></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The disadvantage of obtaining fully decoupled spectra is that all information about how many protons are coupled to each carbon is lost.  Since information about the number and chemical shifts of C, CH, CH<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub> carbons is valuable in making structure and spectral assignments, several types of experiments to determine <sup>13</sup>C multiplicities have been developed (fully coupled spectra are not usually used because of extensive signal overlap and poor signal-to-noise).</p>
<p><b><a name="06-cmr-01-spectra-sford">Single Frequency Off-Resonance Decoupling (SFORD)</a>.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The oldest method for determining attached protons is the SFORD technique, now replaced by more efficient methods.  It involves application of a powerful <b>single frequency</b> proton decoupling 500-2000 Hz upfield or downfield of the proton chemical shifts in the sample.  All C-H couplings are reduced in proportion to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  The distance (&Delta;&delta;) from the decoupler frequency to the proton position,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  The power of the decoupler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Typical experiments would reduce the normal one-bond couplings of 125-250 Hz to perhaps 12-20 Hz, and the longer range couplings to &lt;1 Hz.  The spectrum now appears as a series of singlets, doublets, triplets and quartets depending on whether the carbon is quaternary, or has one, two or three protons attached. Fig. 6-1.3 illustrates the effect of decoupler offset on the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum of methanol.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Figure 6-1.3</b>.  Methyl carbon quartet of methanol obtained for various offsets of the decoupler frequency from the <sup>1</sup>H chemical shift of methanol (from Wehrli and Wirthlin).</p>

<p>Some difficulties with this technique are:</p>
<p>1.  Sensitivity is not very good.</p>
<p>2.  Multiplets are not always clean.</p>
<p>3.  For complex molecules, some regions of the spectrum can become hopelessly crowded.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:12pt; color:#990000;">6-CMR-1.4 Spectral Editing</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of multi-pulse experiments which render the signals in a <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum with positive and negative intensities (sometimes zero) according to the number of attached protons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>J-Modulated Spectra</b>.  This is the most primitive form of spectral editing.  By placing a suitable delay time between the pulse and the beginning of the acquisition, spectra are obtained in which C and CH<sub>2</sub> groups are positive, and CH and CH<sub>3</sub> are negative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this experiment, after the pulse there is a short delay, during which the decoupler is turned off, and the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum becomes modulated by the CH coupling frequency. After the delay the decoupler is turned on, and the FID is recorded.   If the delay is 1/<i>J</i> then the quaternary and CH<sub>2</sub> carbons are positive, and the CH and CH<sub>3</sub> signals are negative. If the delay is 1/2<i>J</i> all peaks except quaternary are nulled. Of course, experiments of this type will only work properly if the <i>J</i><sub>C-H</sub> are the same for all carbons, which is not always the case, leading to some artifacts when the coupling is unusually large, as for C&equiv;C-H. More on this experiment in <a href="08-tech-09-2D.htm">Sect 8-Tech-9.1</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a name="06-cmr-01-spectra-dept">DEPT</a></b> (Distortionless Enhancement of Polarization Transfer): The DEPT technique has proven superior to others in providing information on attached protons reliably, efficiently and with high selectivity.  It is a proton-carbon polarization transfer method, so DEPT spectra are actually more sensitive than normal acquisitions. A set of spectra with pulse delays adjusted for &pi;/2 (DEPT-90) and 3&pi;/4 (DEPT-135) are taken.  The DEPT-90 spectrum shows only CH carbons, the DEPT-135 shows positive CH<sub>3</sub> and CH, and negative CH<sub>2</sub> signals. It is important to understand that the appearance of positive and negative signals can be reversed by phasing, so it is necessary to have some way of determining whether the spectrum has been phased for CH<sub>2</sub> positive or negative.  Quaternary carbons are invisible (Fig. 6-1.4).</p>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Figure 6-1.4</b>.  The normal <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum and a typical set of DEPT spectra of an alkyne.  Note the absence of the quaternary alkyne carbons in the DEPT spectra, and the presence of small peaks for the CH<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub> signals in the DEPT-90 spectrum, which, in principle, should have only CH signals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Leakage&#34; can occur in DEPT-90 spectra because <sup>1</sup><i>J</i><sub>C-H</sub> varies as a function of environment, and the technique assumes that all <i></i><sup>1</sup><i>J</i><sub>C-H</sub> are identical. This can result in small peaks for CH<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub> signals, which should have zero intensity.  For similar reasons the C-H of terminal acetylenes (C&equiv;C-H) will show anomalous intensities in DEPT spectra (either nulled or very small in DEPT-90, or present in DEPT-135) because the C-H coupling is much larger (around 250 Hz) than the normal value of 125 Hz for which the DEPT experiment is usually parameterized. Of course, leakage can also result from an incorrectly calibrated pulse width for the spectrometer.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:12pt; color:#990000;">6-CMR-1.5 Referencing C-13 NMR Spectra</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tetramethylsilane (TMS) is the primary reference for C-13 spectra.  The relatively low sensitivity of C-13 NMR requires the addition of substantial amounts of TMS, so it is common to use solvent peaks as a secondary reference.  Below are listed chemical shifts of several common solvents used in NMR spectroscopy.  Note that isotope shifts are quite large in C-13 NMR, so separate values are reported for the deuterated and protonated solvents (from Levy, <i>J. Magn. Res.</i> <b>1972</b>, <i>6</i>, 143; Reich unpublished work).</p>
