<p><b><span style="font-size:10pt; color:#B6120A;">Palladium Catalyzed Coupling Reactions</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a family of coupling reactions in which a organometallic reagent (typically a Sn, B, Zn or Mg reagent) is treated with an electrophile (usually an iodide, bromide, or triflate) in the presence of a Pd catalyst, to form cross-coupled products.  These reactions are of such importance that each of the organometallic reagent couplings is a separate name reaction, organostannane couplings are Stille reactions, organoborane couplings are Suzuki reactions, organozinc couplings are Negishi reactions, and organomagnesium couplings are Kumada reactions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mechanism: </b>All of these reactions proceed by a common mechanism.  The process is initiated by reaction of the Pd(0) species with the halide to form a Pd(II) alkyl iodide (Pd(0) should be considered a nucleophile, and a reducing reagent, much in the way Mg&#176; is in the formation of a Grignard reagent).  After this oxidative addition the Pd(II) species (which is now a Pd electrophile) performs a transmetalation on the organometallic component -- a Pd/Sn, Pd/B or Pd/Zn exchange -- to form a diorganopalladium (II) intermediate.  This species then undergoes a reductive elimination to form the C-C bond, and return the catalyst to the Pd(0) oxidation state. If a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling is performed under a CO atmosphere  then there may be a C=O insertion, such that both fragments become substituents on a ketone (carbonylative coupling).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the metals has advantages and disadvantages in their use. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stille couplings (Pd/Sn)</b>  work well, and organotin compounds are the only organometallic coupling partners that can be purified easily, and they can be stored.  However organotin compounds are toxic, and the separation of products from starting materials and byproducts can be very difficult.  They are also poorly suited for alkyl couplings, since there are typically several alkyl group on tin.  In fact, alkyl couplings are generally problematic, because of potential &beta;-hydride eliminations in either of the two Pd(II) intermediates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suzuki couplings (Pd/B)</b>, are usually done using R'-B(OR)<sub>2</sub> compounds but they work well even with trialkyl boranes.  The alkenyl and alkyl borate starting materials can often be easily made by hydroboration reactions. However, they do require the presence of base to form the boron ate complexes, and organoboranes are too reactive for easy purification. However, left-over starting organoborates, and other byproducts can often be easily removed because of their polar nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Negishi  couplings (Pd/Zn)</b> show excellent reactivity, but the organozinc compounds show less functional group compatibility because of their higher reactivity, and the higher reactivity of the Li and Mg reagents often used to prepare them. They seem to be especially well suited for alkyl couplings.</p>
